	<!-- <p>Who knows how much better I could be now. But I’ve always felt that life’s too short to do just one thing. Downtime was well spent with an eclectic mix of friends into theater, art, food, and music. And working at the campus paper as a graphic designer among journalism, art, and business majors was, for me, more fun than interning with other programmers.</p> -->
	<!-- <p>That’s what <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanluisobispo/obituary.aspx?pid=89296016">Dr. Attala</a> advised we do said on our first day in the program.

	<!-- <p>That was Dr. Attala’s advice on our first day in the program. Life’s too full of interesting to dedicate yourself to just one thing—especially if that thing is writing code.</p> -->
	<p>That was Dr. Attala’s advice on our first day. Apparently there was this life outside of computer programming, and he was insistent we embrace it.</p>
	<p>He was right. I learned a lot from an eclectic mix of friends into theater, art, food, and music. And working at the campus paper as a graphic designer among journalism, art, and business majors helped balance the hours I spent glued to a lab terminal.</p>

	<!-- <p>Computer science taught me how to build stuff right. But everything else taught me how to build the right stuff. It was a multidisciplinary environment that would later help me make connections across seemingly unrelated topics, often as a design guy among developers, but sometimes a dev guy among designers.</p> -->
	<p>Engineering taught me to build stuff right. Everything else taught me to build the right stuff. This realization would help me make connections between seemingly unrelated topics, often as a design guy among developers, and sometimes a dev guy among designers.</p>

	<p>While a diverse upbringing would steer me away from a pure development role, code is still my clay. </p>
	<p>But my interest in programming stays keen. As a designer who works mainly on software, it’s  I understand the medium. There's art in code. I enjoy the freedom to explore my own ideas on this site. </p>
	<!-- <p>But I’ll probably always be a programmer at heart. It took me a while to realize, but code is just as much an art medium as any. Though there’s less downtime these days, I hope the occasional interactive study or article will make its way here.</p> -->
