	<p>	Learn an instrument, play a sport, write poetry – just don’t be a nerd. That was <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sanluisobispo/obituary.aspx?pid=89296016">Dr. Attala</a>’s advice for getting a holistic perspective, and he’d be right. Computer science would show me how to build for machines. But an eclectic mix of colleagues from engineering, music, theatre, journalism, design, and business would show me how to build for people.</p>

	<p>Building for people and machines: It’s a balance I’ve tried to keep for over 15 years, and one that I’m lucky to continue at <a href="https://punchcut.com">Punchcut</a> in San Francisco. As a design lead and technologist, I’ve guided high-performing teams of interaction, visual, and motion designers in shaping the future of fitness, automotive, finance, and education experiences. I’ve also had the privilege to mentor emerging designers from University of Cincinnati, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brigham Young University.</p>

	<p>Build things right. Build the right things. But above all, keep building.</p>
	<!-- <p>Build things right and build the right things. But above all, keep building. As someone who believes deeply in code as a creative medium, I made this site to share my personal <a href="#/art">work</a> and <a href="#/word">thoughts</a> on interactive media.</p> -->
