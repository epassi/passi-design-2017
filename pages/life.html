	<p>Learn an instrument, play a sport, write poetry – just don’t be a nerd. That was their advice for getting us nerds to have a holistic perspective. They’d be right. Computer science would show me how to build for machines. But an eclectic mix of colleagues from engineering, music, theatre, journalism, design, and business would show me how to build for people.</p>

	<p>People and machines. It’s a dialog I’ve designed for over 15 years, and one that I’m lucky to be crafting today at <a href="https://punchcut.com">Punchcut</a>. As a design lead and technologist, I’ve guided high-performing teams of interaction, visual, and motion designers in shaping the future of fitness, automotive, finance, and education experiences. I’ve also had the privilege of mentoring new designers from University of Cincinnati, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brigham Young University.</p>
