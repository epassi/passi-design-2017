	<p>Who knows how much better I could be now. But I’ve always felt that life’s too short to do just one thing. Downtime was well spent with an eclectic mix of friends into theater, art, food, and music. And working at the campus paper as a graphic designer among journalism, art, and business majors was, for me, more fun than interning with other programmers.</p>
	<p>Computer science taught me how to build stuff right. But everything else taught me how to build the right stuff. It was a multidisciplinary environment that would later help me make connections across seemingly unrelated topics, often as a design guy among developers, but sometimes a dev guy among designers.</p>
	<p>Today I’m a design lead and technologist at Punchcut in San Francisco. As a technologist, I specialize in UI prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a lead, I’ve guided high-performing teams of interaction, visual, and motion designers to define user experiences for fitness, automotive, finance, and education companies. I’ve also mentored emerging design talent from University of Cincinnati, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brigham Young University.</p>
	<p>But I’ll probably always be a programmer at heart. It took me a while to realize, but code is just as much an art medium as any. Though there’s less downtime these days, I hope the occasional interactive study or article will make its way here.</p>
