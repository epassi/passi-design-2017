	<p>Computer Science taught me how to build for machines. But an eclectic mix of classmates from engineering, music, theatre, journalism, design, and business taught me how to build for people.</p>

	<p>People &amp; Machines: it’s a relationship I’ve cultivated for over 15 years, and one I’m lucky to be designing today at <a href="https://punchcut.com">Punchcut</a>. As a design lead and technologist, I’ve guided exceptional teams of interaction, visual, and motion designers in shaping the future of fitness, automotive, finance, and education experiences. I’ve also had the privilege of mentoring new designers from University of Cincinnati, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brigham Young University.</p>
