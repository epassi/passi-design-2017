	<p>It’s a tension I’ve resolved for over 15 years, sometimes as the design guy among developers, and sometimes as the dev guy among designers.</p>

	<p>I strike this balance today at <a href="https://punchcut.com">Punchcut</a>. As a design lead and technologist, I’ve guided high-performing teams of interaction, visual, and motion designers in shaping the future of fitness, automotive, finance, and education experiences. I’ve also had the privilege to mentor emerging designers from University of Cincinnati, Rhode Island School of Design, and Brigham Young University.</p>

	<p>Believing deeply in code as a creative medium, I created this site to share my personal <a href="#/art">work</a> and <a href="#/word">thoughts</a> on interactive media.</p>
